# Math Art
Inspired by [a stackoverflow question](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35569/tweetable-mathematical-art), this project allows you to create interesting images through mathematics. It generates an image  by getting an `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` value from 4 defined functions for each pixel. Each function gets the following parameters passed in:

- `x`: the x coordinate of the given pixel
- `y`: the y coordinate of the given pixel
- `w`: the width of the image
- `h`: the height of the image

Hover to the top of the page to edit the functions and click on the image to apply new functions. You can check this page out on the [GitHub Pages deployment](https://joyal-mathew.github.io/math-art/).

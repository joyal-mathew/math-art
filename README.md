# Math Art
Inspired by [a stackoverflow question](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35569/tweetable-mathematical-art), this project allows you to create interesting images through mathematics. It generates an image  by getting an `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` value from 4 defined functions for each pixel. Each function gets the following parameters passed in:
- `x`: the x coordinate of the given pixel
- `y`: the y coordinate of the given pixel
- `w`: the width of the image
- `h`: the height of the image

Hover to the top of the page to edit the functions and click on the image to apply new functions.
